This sets your working directory to the Code folder. This is an important step!  Without it, R won't be able to find the data files, which have all been put in the Data folder which is found relative to the location of your Lecture1 folder. Both the Data folder and your Code folder are in the R_Course folder (their 'parent' folder). So to find a data file, we can simply find Lecture1's parent (the R_Course folder) and then go to the Data folder (which is in the R_Course folder) and find the data file there. (The absolute paths to the files could be included in the code but that is awkward in the class-room environment, because everybody's path would be different, depending on where they unpacked their zip file with the Course materials.)
Once upon a tie therre were three bears. A father bear who was very big, a mother bear, not quite so large and a baby bear who really was not very big at all.  The three bears liked to eat bowls of porridge for breakfast and they had bowls which were very big, not quite so big and rather small.
